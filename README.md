### Requirements

This project requires me to build an interactive front-end site. The site will respond to the users' actions, allowing users to actively engage with data, alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals.

Required technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### Design

As this is my first time using javascript I have based the design off the  ”Love Maths” - project. The code from some of that project has been used in my project and has been noted in the css additionaly I have used code from online sources and javascript & jquery by Jon Duckett when developing the design for this project.

My aim has been to create a website that allows users to simply play the game without alot of distraction.

#### Colours

I drew inspiration from different youtube videos for the colour selection for the website the majoirty of the colours selected were primary colours that I then used the pop up color board in css to find appropiate colours to suit the different icons.


## Features 

The  website is a single page website that consists of the following sections:

 - Title
 - Rules Area
 - Score Area
 - Game Area

### Existing Features

#### Title

  - The title is a h1 element that has been centred and the text styled with a font of Amatic SC and the font size increased to 4.0rem to give a very simple but effective title.

#### Score area

  - The score area provides the user with a visual results board that shows the result of each of the five rounds at the end of each round the score area will notify the player if it was a win loss or draw with the computer as seen in image 1,2,3 below. At the end of the game the player is notified of the winner or looser of the game as seen in image 4 and 5 below

- the Buttons for the game area were taken from font awesome https://fontawesome.com/
- to make the buttons stand out they will enlarge when hovered over.
- the colour of the icon will also change when hovered or clicked on.

### Future features

- Later versions of this project will contain a improved method of displaying the results of the round as well as edditing the position and css styling of the page to make it more modern. The java script will be improved to include a pop up celebration notification when the player wins.
